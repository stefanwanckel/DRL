Description: # widowx_env
        
        widowx_env is a series of OpenAI Gym reinforcement learning environments. 
        It simulates a robotic arm (WidowX MK-II) with the Pybullet engine. The goal is to bring the end-effector as close as possible to the target position (represented as a green sphere).
